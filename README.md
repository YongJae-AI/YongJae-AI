## 🔬 About Me  
I am an AI Engineer specializing in **deep learning, computer vision, MLOps, and scientific machine learning**.  
With a background in **Naval Architecture & Ocean Engineering**, I have hands-on experience conducting experimental hydrodynamics using **3D depth cameras, motion capture systems, and high-speed CCD cameras** for measurement and image processing.  
I focus on designing physics-aware ML pipelines and applying models such as **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to real-world sensor-driven data.
